So many people either straight up refuse to use they/them when addressing me or make some sort of side comment about how they've never met a trans person before. 
Far too many bigoted conversations about trans women in sports it's ridiculous. Transmisogyny in particular is alive and well on our campuses and it stresses me out that trans women and transfems aren't getting the support they need (disproportionately so). Had one of my friends tell me that the trans healthcare doctor on campus refuses to refill prescriptions (especially for HRT) without an appointment (which is narrowly impossible because she's so backlogged) or a fax (which students have to pay for). 
Vivek Goel using ""gender ideology"" during a community forum was crazy work. Goes to show the lack of knowledge surrounding transphobic dogwhistles. ","Anything that has occurred in terms of anti-transphobia support has only been within the last year and therefore is very underdeveloped. Most of the things available are once again student-led initiatives. ","There is no updated map as to where the all-gender washrooms are located which can be really stressful for trans students.

More programming and case studies offered to students, staff, and faculty on how to address and limit their own indoctrinated transphobia.

","More staff and faculty with the knowledge surrounding TFGBV and GBV. ","I think that I actively go out of my way to seek out courses that will cover this information. Generally though, it is very unlikely that students will be given the necessary education. I'm sure if you asked someone who wasn't in arts to explain sexism and misogyny and how they're interconnected, they would not be able to do so. It ought to be mandatory for all students (regardless of program) to take an ARTS First or GSJ course. ","Only in classes where it is pertinent to class content.

They seemed to be yelling at all the women who passed by.
I had a friend group in my first year that would belittle me and sexualize women. I brought this to the attention of one of my friends but she dismissed it. One of the guys later assaulted the same friend when she was drunk.
Many more.","Because I am a GSJ student, often misogyny is talked about in my classwork and we address some of the erasure of women in academia. I know the women's center does a lot of work on campus.","The engineering, computer science, and STEM faculties in general are known areas where misogyny is allowed to continue. This is not a generalization it is a direct result of the structure of the degree. Men dominate class population and professors do not check misogyny as it arises. These students are not required to research structural violence and challenge their beliefs.","Of course. I have been put in group assignments with men who thought I was underqualified, stupid, and incapable of making decisions for the group because I dress femininely.

The attack on the GSJ classroom and subsequent lack of action.
I have seen people stop, turn back, and walk all the way around to avoid touching a pride flag on the ground.
The known anti-queer church covers campus in advertisements to attend church at the beginning of each term.","I have seen admin avoid the term ""hate crime"" like it was a fucking disease after the attack in Spring 2023, despite the clear application. I have seen performative crosswalks and flags. In terms of good work, I know GLOW has a long-standing presence on campus."," It is no coincidence Geovanny Villalba-Aleman was a STEM student. It no accident that he was a known bigot with violent intentions. The admin and STEM faculties like to pretend that they are not responsible to the moral and political actions of their students, but that ignores how much our campus creates the moral and political spaces. The UWaterloo reddit, Math NEWS, and other known areas that platform hate and lead students along the alt-right pipeline are left unchecked. First years are immediately indoctrinated into a campus where a man planned and executed a hate crime and the school did nothing. We could not even close campus for a day to mourn. We could not better GSJ funding. The defecate is more important to the admin than the health and safety of our queer students. I don't care that the students and prof didn't end up dying. I don't care that we didn't see a copycat attack in the following year. The admin did nothing the prevent these outcomes and has been lucky that nothing happened. All students should receive anti-racism, anti-queerphobia and transphobia, anti-misogyny, and other training as part of orientation or a core first year course. Social and political realities should be integral to all courses because there is no knowledge that is isolated from politics. Engineering and Computer Science are not apolitical and to treat them as such is to allow building and AI to be as discriminatory as they are.",Yes.,"Yes, please specify:","TERFs, transmedicalists, and conservative queers perpetuate internalized queerphobia all the time.

In good news I know we have been increasing the number of non-gendered washrooms.,"The transphobic ideals that are allowed to continue in online forums like the UWaterloo reddit need to be addressed. When a student exhibits transphobia, it should be taken as the threat of violence that it is. The people who met him and select staff members knew that Geovanny Villalba-Aleman was transphobic and queerphobic. His violence was not addressed until it was nearly fatal. We need early intervention programs for students and staff exhibiting hate speech.","Yes. My courses have not been the same since the attack.

People saying ""they don't get the whole pronouns thing."" People saying they ""don't care if someone's trans, as long as they don't make it their whole personality.""

I have worked to continue the GSJ society and create community within the program.,,Maybe,Maybe,"Something that I struggle with with events aimed as GSJ students is a lack of attendance. We are a small program, but maybe there are other barriers to student attendance that should be addressed. In terms of the society, it requires a lot of labour from myself and 2-3 other people to try and create space for community and sometimes this labour seems to be in vain. I wish WUSA didn't make reimbursement and event forms so strict. I wish I didn't have to create the space I need. At the same time, I understand why WUSA needs the admin and why students societies must be run by students. I just wish there was some break or reward student advocates could recieve.","First, I want the admin to stop harassing and shutting down pro-Palestinian work. Second, I would like to see profs, especially STEM profs, be proactive in including EDI-R training in their classes (which could be done in collaboration with the EDI-R office). Third, public walks/protests/vigils that remind our community of the attack and try to heal. I have met so many students who didn't even know the attack occurred. We need to preserve this history to truly heal. The warning system is not enough.",I do but that is because of my unique position as a Gender and Social Justice student,Very in my GSJ courses and slightly in any non-GSJ class

But one of the guys i used to be friends with said the reason divorce rates spike at the age range of 50 is because women go through menopause and start acting differently and hormonally and they completely change and decided to divorce their husbands for no good reason. We later found out that the reason why that guy said that was because his own parents were getting a divorce. Like okay lil bro, that's your own personal experience, sucks to be you but the reason divorce rates spike at 50 is not because ""women are hormonal and emotional and because of their menopause"" its because at that age the kids are usually grown and left the house and the women then leaves because she stayed with that man for the sake of the kids and since the kids left home she also has no reason to stay with that man. It can also take decades to gather the courage to leave an abusive relationship. Anything goes wrong in a mans life = lets blame and hate women for our own issues. ",yes,"Teach girls the right things to say to shut the men down, or teach girls to sopt avoid these men like the plauge. when these incels realize like women avoid them like diseases, they might finally learrn something (doubt it, hard to imagine these people to have any sense of self awareness or take accountability) ","UM YES.

Its up to men to be better. It should not be a women's job to teach men to be respectful, have empathy and be a decent person. It is the most basic thing you as a human being can do. Misogyny was always a thing but because of social media and these red pill influencers and a boy hearing since childhood women are Golddiggers, women must ""obey"" and ""submit"" to them, women are the reason for all of your problems, if a boy has been hearing that as a kid then by adulthood how do u expect to change their demented views ","Show men there are consequences for all the god awful things they think and say about women. Also can i add that sometimes a womens biggest enemy is not other men, its literally other women. Im sorry but no one hates women more than other women. Alot of women have deep interal misogyny in them. The shame other girls who speak out. The love male attention and validation. They see no problem with misogynistic men. I think teaching other girls to be aware and weary of misogynistic men (and women) is the first step. Show them signs of these men, show them what to say, when not to engage, when to speak back, when to ignore. Show women that a man can never and will never dim your light and THEY HAVE NO POWER OVER YOU. They can never hurt you if u dont let it happen. ","Most of the misogyny in the class is very subtle. These men are great performers. They first pretend to be so nice and sweet. You think theres no way this guy is like the other monsters I have had the displeasure of meeting.

Small comments of that insinuate how I am an extension of my partner (a male in my class), your girl, control your woman, comments along those lines. Blatant support of Trump and all that he stands for appeared out of no where when he won the election, debates and comments of how none his misogynistic, transphobic, racist policies matter because 'he'll fix the economy'.

I have seen many comments on queer individuals posts that threaten them with violence simply because there is a male presenting individual wearing makeup. The entire notion that drag queens are sexual aggressors harming the children by reading them a Robert Munch story book was an entire wave of queerphobia that I did not expect. There are religious individuals who still use a well-known mistranslated verse (Man shall not lay with man, correct translation Man shall not lay with boy) to spread hatred to queer individuals.

One in particular was a peer purposefully deadnaming a mutual transgender peer of ours to their face. This individual had begun their transition a year into school, so many people met her with a different name. She came out to everyone and began her transition with her chosen name. An individual that had lived in residence with us would not stop deadnaming, it was very disgusting behaviour to witness, and no amount of ""how dare you, you shouldn't do that, why are you disrespecting a human being"" etc. made this person change their ways.","Gender Neutral bathrooms create a safe space, especially for those in early stages of transition. Pronouns have become basically a campus wide necessity which is fantastic",,,"Yes, please specify:","This minority seems to be experiencing a lot of hatred in the current political climate. There are a lot of online threats of violence and murder that I have seen directed at transgender people. Its often under the disguise of ""protect the women and children, no man can pee where my wife pees"" which is wildly incorrect and a poor excuse to hate. I have seen people celebrating the fact that a Cis-gendered woman was fired from her job because shes 6'4 and a man stormed in on her in the bathroom and accused her of being trans. They are celebrating peoples lives being harmed by their hate.",Somewhat,Somewhat,No,No,,,,,,"Individual Advocacy, I think creating a campus where people feel supported by the university in standing up for themselves would be great. A lot of situations are not so intense that they can be escalated, they are small comments or actions and I notice many people don't say anything out of fear it becomes worse.",No,Very comfortable as I have a support system of people I know I can rely on to protect/help me if needed

Beds were made while we were out, doors unlocked after roommate’s had locked them, random items appeared while no one had been in room. They did not care, said it is normal but admitted that a worker was accessing our floor and locks without instruction. The president said he would not do anything about it as it is probably just “boys being boys”. One morning my roommate and I woke up to the maintenance man turning off our lock and opening our door, while I was still in bed. He was also messing with another girls lock. This is when we asked why he was there and they had no explanation. Supposedly he was auditing the locks to see who had been accessing them but later the employees said no, he does not need to access the locks for that, that it is done through a computer upstairs. They even accused one girl of screaming and throwing a tantrum while in a meeting addressing the problem, but she has video proof that that is false. Found tape and hair in our food about 6 times and rarely even ate at Watsons the month we were there because the hours are horrible. Multiple other problems with male residents violating girl’s physical boundaries without real repercussions. They would ignore our complaints for weeks (which were on file and had been addressed in person with dons and other faculty) then claim to never have heard of the issue. During the rooms being broken into we had to BEG for something to be done and for them to notify all the students of the rez, as they seemed to care more about their image than the actual students. Yes we got a full refund for the month stayed, but it seemed as their last attempt to “help” us. Not a great fix. (This occurred September-October 2022). Most of the female employees were helpful but the men were not. Was quite disappointed by this experience as I was excited to live on campus first year and had made friends there. I can say the rooms are very nice as well as the washrooms (which is why I chose to stay here) but the institution needs to work on listening to their students. When paying close to 14k to live somewhere you expect to feel safe, have privacy and have food free of hair. It says in their rez guidelines that no one will enter your room without consent, but they clearly do not listen to their own rules. For instance, after many girls had complained they gave us physical room keys (which were completely useless as the person with a master fob also has access to a master key). The problem was they did not tell us this and WENT INTO OUR ROOMS WITHOUT TELLING US to drop them off. Who in their right mind sees girls terrified that someone is going into their rooms without their knowledge then does exactly that? Luckily, no one was physically harmed but these types of things often escalate into physical attacks and stalking. I do not like to think about what would have happened if my roommate and I had done nothing when they acted like we were crazy for being concerned. Again, they only sat down with us after we told a bunch of people and got parents involved. We understood that yes there wasn’t any physical proof of this so no investigation could be done by campus police but when 10 girls are scared about their safety, you should listen and do more then tell us to lock our doors and put up cameras on ONE of three floors affected. Not to mention how guys who live there overstep many womens boundaries with little to no repercussions. One guy goes into girls beds even if they do not want that. He was not kicked out simply moved to another floor, with other girls he could potentially harass. Theres many more like this but I am not well versed on those instances.

edit: they did audit our door locks (to see if anyone had been opening them other than us) and apparently found nothing. BUT obviously someone had been coming in, they could have turned off the locks entirely to come in, which we know is possible as we caught someone doing this. Also after a meeting with the president (literally 5 minutes after it) another room was broken into while the girls were away and they came back to their door being open. This was after we had made many complaints so they were very careful about locking it, but still someone got around that.",Yes,"Real action, not performative.
